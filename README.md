hi im nathan!

**Automation enthusiast**. 
I started my journey at 15, reselling sneakers during quarantine. 
That curiosity quickly evolved into building bots and bypassing anti-bot measures such as Cloudflare, Akamai, and advanced TLS fingerprinting checks. 
Since then, Iâ€™ve expanded into developing a wide range of bots and automation tools, including blockchain and Web3 systems.
