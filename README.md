Hello, I'm @naethun (Nathan). The start of my CS career began with a discord bot with friends over quarantine. I started coding out of boredom, now it's a huge passion of mine. 

- I'm majoring in computer science at San Diego State University.
- I am in the proccess to learn more languages, JS being my more fluent language.
- Currently working on automation for NFTs
