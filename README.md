hi im nathan!

i started my journey at 15, reselling sneakers during quarantine.
quickly pipelined into building bots and bypassing anti-bot measures such as Cloudflare, Akamai, TLS fingerprinting checks, etc. 
since then, ive expanded into developing a wide range of bots and automation tools, including blockchain and web3 systems.
