hi im nathan!

i started my journey at 15, reselling sneakers during quarantine.<br><br>
quickly pipelined into building bots and bypassing anti-bot measures such as cloudflare, akamai, TLS fingerprinting checks, etc. <br><br>
since then, ive expanded into developing a wide range of bots and automation tools, including blockchain and web3 systems.
